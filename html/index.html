<h1>Welcome to Chimera Quest!</h1>
<p>
Chimera Quest is a tabletop RPG based on the genre of dark fantasy. It is a game
meant for epic fights and doomed heroes where the only goal in the game is to
survive and if you can do that, make the world a slightly better place. While
this RPG is generally shaped by the Game Master, it is intended for mature and
somewhat experienced audiences. This RPG is built on a D6 (6-sided dice for the
uninitiated) dice pool system. While some aspects of this system have been
inspired by other tabletop games the design is meant to balance both the
narrative approach of some RPGs with the dangerous combat offered by dark
fantasy settings.
